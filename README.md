# EventSourcing

A collection of building blocks that can be used as a foundation for event-sourced Domain-Driven Design applications.
The principles of Domain-Driven Design have been laid out by Eric Evans in his book "Domain-Driven Design". This package is based on 
the excellent book "A Pattern Language for Event Sourcing in Python" from John Bywater in which he describes a concrete implementation
of the forementioned principles.
